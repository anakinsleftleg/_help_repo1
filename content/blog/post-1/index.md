> Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.

Wouldn't that bring about chaos? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Computer, lights up!
